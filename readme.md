# Java Collections & Modern Java Practice

This repository contains examples demonstrating various features of Java Collections Framework.

## üìö Table of Contents

### 1. Lists

#### [ArrayList](src/ArrayList.java)
This file demonstrates different ways to work with ArrayLists and Lists in Java. It shows basic ArrayList operations (add, set, remove) and covers different types of List initialization. It explains how `Arrays.asList()` creates a fixed-size list where elements can be modified but size cannot be changed, `List.of()` creates a completely immutable list, and `new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(...))` creates a fully modifiable list. The examples demonstrate adding elements at specific indices, replacing elements using set(), and iterating through lists.

#### [Comparator](src/Comparatorexample.java)
This file showcases different ways to sort objects using Comparators in Java. It includes a custom com.skv.corejava.Student class with name and GPA fields to demonstrate object sorting. The implementation shows multiple approaches including bare metal way using lambda expressions with proper handling of decimal comparisons, modern Java comparator using method references (com.skv.corejava.Student::getGpa), chaining comparators with thenComparing, and reverse ordering. Additional examples demonstrate sorting integer lists in ascending/descending order and sorting strings by length.
